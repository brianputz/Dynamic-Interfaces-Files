Demos for the Dynaimc Interfaces talk on 4-20-2011
=========================================

Most work was pretty derivative from Daniel Shiffman's work.  Download his sources that I abuse liberally here: http://www.shiffman.net/2010/11/14/kinect-and-processing/
---------------------

The 4 demos are as follows:

handTrack
	The basic single hand tracking demo

handDraw
	The one handed drawing demo
	
image
	The taco based minority report demo
	
c_kinect
	The demo of taking snapshots of people point clouds.  This one gets a bit buggy in edit mode, but may still be fun to play with
